<h1>Basic Information</h1>
 

 
<p align="Left">Name: Kina Buvelle<p>
<p align="left">Weight: 127lbs   <p>                                                             
<p align="left">Height: 5'4<p>
<p align="left">Age: Seventeen<p>
<p align="left">Gender: Female<p>
<p align="left">Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual / Bicurious<p>
<p align="left">Race: Human<p>
<p align="left">Rank: Archmage ( Faith + Geo )<p>
<p align="left">Primary Tree: Faith<p>
<p align="left">Secondary Tree: Geomancy<p>
<p align="left">Points: 439 <p>
<p align="left">Appearance: Kina's body doesn't have the distinct hourglass figure that a lot of girls have, her shape making more of a curve than a point to her waist and leads down into another smooth curve to her hips and long legs. Her skin is a light peach shade, some considering her to be pale. Her platinum blonde hair frames her skin causing her to look a little darker than she really looks. <p>
Her facial structure is distinctly European, her narrow nose pricking up at the tip as well as her plump pink lips. Kina's cheekbones are the widest part of her face which causes it to have a slight heart shape that leads into her narrow jaw which fits her overall frame perfectly. Her baby blue eyes are often described as piercing.<p>
<p align="left">Personality: Kina is a fairly kind individual, often putting the needs of others beyond her own. She would do next to anything to help another if the need proposed itself to her, given it be something she is able to help with. Calm and contemplative, she lost most her impulsiveness and temperament issues quickly after arriving at Ulreich. <p>
Kina still has her sense of humor and is still slightly feisty but she gained a bit more gentleness. She now strives to uphold peace and promote prosperity but is definitely not above fighting for what she believes is right, especially it is keeps those she loves out of danger.

<h1>History</h1>
 

It was a version of the new world unlike any other. It had been perfectly aligned with the original New World’s timeline before straying off into a unique path. For this version, there was no Renaissance era. So, instead of an explosion of art, the world had a technological boom. This allowed the human race to have access to higher forms of technology, and fast forwarded into the present time, the scene was unbelievable.<p>
It was exactly what many fantasy/science fiction storybooks had foretold for hundreds or thousands of years into the future, although it was simply April third in the year 2057. In London, England, a small baby girl was born with bright blonde hair and striking blue eyes. Kina, as the child would be named, was an odd yet caring creature. She would often bring in stray animals that she found on her own little adventures around the street block that she lived on to her father who would patch them up and nurse them back to health until they found an owner worthy of the girl’s standards.<p>
The only reason her father was around the house full time was because her mother, Alice Buvelle, was a high ranking Officer in the British Tech Navy. The Tech Navy was a branch of the military that oversaw Sea warfare, as well as pushing the exploration of the sea floor through the help of specialized undersea machines crafted out of a high durability metal alloy that allowed them to delve as far deep into the ocean without succumbing to underwater pressure and causing an internal collapse of the vehicle. Over time the relationship between mother and daughter dwindled into nothing.<p>
Kina had many friends growing up, and even attended a highly expensive private school that offered the best education in all of England. These friends of hers would tell her stories about the holidays that they spent together with their happy family and she realized that..comparing her personal experiences to her friends’, she didn’t have a very happy family. Her mother wasn’t home very often, and when she was the woman barraged her father with verbal abuse. They never celebrated the holidays, never visited family for functions. She lived a closed and sad life.<p>
Around the age of fifteen, horrifying news struck her like a cold slap to the face. Her mother had sold falsified evidence that the United Kingdom had been testing out nukes that were laced with explosive mana, in effect creating a radioactive bomb, on sparse locations in Russia and the United States, and caused many unborn, newborns, and young children to develop grotesque physical mutations. She did this for magic power, which both angered and terrified the girl. In a flash, a war was upon them. <p>
The war itself wasn’t fought with technology, for the most part the most dominating factor was magic, but technology certainly supported it. The battles fought throughout the United Kingdom were so high in mana concentration that it caused a temporal rift to open up outside of Dover. Eager to escape the havoc, Kina raced through it without a second thought. This rift transported her to the far reaches of the Free Lands in the Esmerelda Isles. This was unknown to her at the time, but quickly she found Ulreich University and vowed that as soon as she was strong enough to return, she would. <p>
She would return to end her mother’s madness, to restore peace to her now broken world.<p>

<h1>Mana Manipulation and Universal Spells</h1>
 

 Mana Manipulation: The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.<p>
Unique Archmage Mana Type: Earth Warden Mana: Earth Warden Mana is a combination of both her Faith Mana and her Geomancy Mana types. This mana is capable of being manifested in both physical and essence-based forms while also being capable of being infused into both sentient and non-sentient beings. Direct contact with Earth Warden mana in its base state without spells will automatically begin healing minor injuries such as scrapes, small cuts, bruises, etc., and when in its base form it may have a physical durability of up to iron strength. Can not be used to harm in any way, shape, or form.<p>
Faith Mana: Mana which cannot do damage in any form. This mana is usually very warm and pleasant, and sometimes even gives off relaxing scents.<p>
Earth Mana: Mana which manifests itself as dirt, mud, dust, etc..<p>
<p>
<font color="#D4AF37">Kina's mana<font color="#808080">, when visible to the naked eye, appears as an aura of bright gold, yet has a thin inner and outer border of a muted shade of brown that blends perfectly into the gold hues. Browns and other nude shades can be seen as small particles drifting inside of her aura.
 <p>
Mana Weave: The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana<p>
Mana Spark: A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.<p>
Mana Pane: When focusing one's mana before them and swirling it in a vortex quickly and violently, one may allow their mana to harden, causing a thin pane to form. This spell can only be used defensively and the power it can block is minimal, ranking at iron toughness. This spell can be learned by anyone of mage rank and above, but upon reaching high mage, one may cast two of these at a time, one for each hand.<p>
Mana Beacon: This spell is cast by concentrating on one's mind and projecting mana outwards like a sudden flash of light. Although this does not produce any visual effects, it sends a beacon-like pulse of mana outwards from ones body which can be picked up an interpreted by other mages who have learned this spell. It does not convey any message, rather a simple alarm. This can be used to send a cry for help to people within a set area of your character.<p>
Gel Sphere: By creating a mana spark and continuing to weave your mana around the spark like a web, eventually the orb one forms will expand into a small sphere of an incredibly adhesive substance. Once casted, this spell lasts for three posts, and has a toughness of aluminum. <p>
Summon Medium:A spell that allows a user to transport their medium from a previous location into their hands. Only one medium can be used at a time with this spell, and can include HMM's, as well as basic objects and weapons. To change one's medium, one must use it at least once before being able to actively summon it. <p>
Mana Meditation: ​This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage meditates on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their undivided attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting--and slowly weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Meditation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance slightly and can calm whatever natural shock they may be experiencing, allowing them to function better. Natural shock meaning the universal spell won't work on magic based shock<p>
Mana Rehabilitation: This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage temporarily focuses on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their most of their attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting or being affected by an external source--and weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Rehabilitation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance by x1.5 and can calm whatever natural shock or magic based shock (spells that cause pain/shock/discomfort of up to Mage rank) that part of their body may be experiencing. (Can take a tiny bit of edge off higher ranked spells, but not very much, will mainly be ineffective to anything higher than mage rank.)

<h1>Spells and Items</h1>
 

 Items -- 
Incandescence ( High Mage Medium ) - Whilst this shield is summoned, all of Kina's buffs' durations are increased by 1.5x of their normal time, and the defensive capabilities of her spells such as Angelic Bulwark are increased by 1.75x. Her geomancy spells also get boosted, the length, width, and height of all of her spells getting increased by 1.5x, all except her Grasping Hands, and Sandstorm. It's durability is equal to that of tungsten, and is very resistant to magic and physical forces alike.<p>
Death's Embrace : A magically enhanced Warhammer retrieved from the siege of Kre'nath. This hammer gives it's holder 2x their base strength, allowing them to wield it with both hands much easier. If struck on any solid surface with enough force, the hammer releases a ring of ice from the point of impact in a three foot radius, the explosive force being enough for the ice to cut through anything equal to or below an Iron density. The handle and the hammer head are both made of Cobalt and the handle is five and a half feet tall, the head adding another foot. This puts it at a whopping six and a half feet tall. The hammer head has a two foot span from handle to each end, making it four feet long in total while being one foot in width.
<p>
 Faith Spells - <p>
Heal - By projecting her mana through the palms of her hands, she floods the recipients body with white mana. The mana mends broken bones, internal bleeding, flesh wounds, and the like. The larger and more devastating the wound, the more mana the spell takes. This can not regenerate lost limbs.<p>
Cleanse - Another spell transmitted via touch. Cleanse targets both magic and physical ailments such as induced blindness, poisons, curses, and other effects. This spell can only cure spells equal to or less than Kina's rank. Does not affect spells she has no knowledge of.<p>
Fortitude - Blesses an ally target, increasing their physical abilities by 1.5x ( strength, endurance, vitality, speed ) and also doubles their pain tolerance. Lasts for five posts.<p>
Angelic Bulwark - By extending her mana from her body in a bubble shape, she forms a thick, protective bubble of mana, it's boundaries distinguished by it's dull golden glow. The spell is like a one-way mirror when it comes to casting spells; if a spell is cast from outside, the bubble absorbs it depending on it's magnitude and rank, and spells cast from inside pass freely. The shield may be passed like air, meaning that inside, it's open season. Can absorb up to one High Mage ranked spell ( varies depending on spell strength. )<p>
Sanctuary - Blesses the ground beneath Kina in a ten meter radius, causing the ground to crack in a spiderweb pattern, light bursting from the cracks. This light heals allied targets for a small amount once every post. Spells cast by harmful entities inside the radius have their spell rank reduced by one rank. Lasts for three posts.<p>
Infusion - After channeling for one post, Kina releases a burst of mana. Allied targets within this blast radius have their next spell cost reduced to half.<p>
Apotheosis - A powerful buff that only applies to the durability of barriers, Kina increases the target's barrier strength by 4x. Rather than increasing the material strength of the barrier, it increases the barrier's ability to absorb damage - I.E. 1 spell of equal rank to 4 spells of equal rank, before breaking. Lasts for 4 posts and has a 2 post cd.<p>
Sensory Pulse - By releasing a pulse of faith mana into the target, the spell works like echolocation. The mana bounces off of every part of them and returns to Kina, allowing her to "see" any internal and external injuries such as internal bleeding, respiratory problems, etc. This spells works to find both physical and magic induced problems and is able to detect harmful spells of up to HM+ rank. Does not detect spells that are intentionally hidden by the caster.<p>
Geomancy Spells -<p>
Wall - Erects a six foot tall, three four foot wide, and three foot thick wall of whichever substance she chooses. Lasts for three posts or until destroyed.<p>
Earthern Needles - Forms the earth into jagged, pointed needles of rock, and sends them towards a target. These are projectile spells, and only three can be summoned at a time.
Spikes - Summons a five foot long spike of earth from the ground, making obstacles and dealing damage on impact.<p>
Sandstorm -Grinds the ground with the force of her mana, and manipulates the sand and debris created. These particles are whirled around her body like a twister, dealing light damage once per post, and heavily reducing eyesight fo5r up to thirty feet from her.<p>
Rock Armament - Focusing her mana around her fists, she wills it to become her tree's respective physical element: Rock. This causes rock to form around her fists, molding to the shape of her hands to form large gauntlets of solid stone which have the durability of Iron. She is able to flex her hands within the gauntlet, which in turn causes the gauntlet to follow her movements like any other normal set of gloves. If she is able to connect a solid punch, the weight behind the punch could easily break bones. The gauntlets are easily fourty each, but to her they feel closer to ten pounds. Can break through Iron defenses with multiple hits.<p>
<p>
Archmage Spells --<p>
Gaia's Shield - Erects a physical barrier that is ten feet wide and tall in a horizontal dome shape. While being cast, the direction that she's facing that front of the dome will form in two layers - A faith and an earthern layer making it much stronger at the front than at the back where they combine and mix into just one. The barrier has a tungsten durability and may be destroyed through two attacks of equal rank towards the front and is reduced to only one attack at the back side. May also take multiple titanium-grade attacks. Once destroyed, the barrier cracks and explodes, releasing sharp iron-grade shrapnel of rock in a fifteen foot radius away from her in all directions that can pierce iron defenses. These do not affect selective targets. The exploding effect may be triggered if the barrier is cracked or damaged but not destroyed yet.<p>
Rapture - After charging for one post, releases a powerful burst of faith mana. The explosive force of it is capable of knocking back a mage with less then or equal to 2x human strength. This spell has two effects: 1 - It heals for light damage to selective targets such to the extent of like a twisted ankle. 2 - It uproots the ground, sending up to four spikes that are three feet long from the ground at awkward angles.<p>
Gift of Stone - A powerful buff that increases physical strength by 3x, while also increasing the recipient's weight to counter balance it. Without the strength buff, they wouldn't be able to move very well. They now weigh as if they were stone ( 50- 100ish lbs increase ). If the target's durability already exceeds stone, then this buff will not be effective at all. This lasts for 4 posts, and has a 1 post cool down time.<p>
Purify - Due to the melding of her pre-Archmage mana types, Kina's mana has taken the next step towards the ultimate goal of removing corruption. By releasing this mana type through her palms, she is able to cast a cleansing spell more powerful than her base Cleanse. This spell is capable of both curing cursed items of up to High Mage rank as long as she is aware of it ( 1 rotation for curses of ranks lower than HM, 2 for HM curses and requires constant contact with the cursed item ), and may even very slowly and with much effort begin to remove corruption from nonbiological earth-based substances as well as battle low and minor traces of corruption from fellow students/patients (can be more effective for heavier corruption damage but will HEAVILY drain mana through multiple casts). This won't regenerate limbs lost or any of the damage that the corruption did to the host, but it will certainly help the cause. ( Works on High Mage rank or lower for DM'd monsters ) Purify can not be used to cure corrupt fiends but may work on the corruption that they spread. Using this spell will always leave her feeling exhausted and may only be used on corrupt patients/cursed items/corrupted earth. Will not affect essence-based corruption or corruption that is formed out of pure energy to any extent. <p>
Earth’s Beating Heart - Kina draws from the very essence that the magic world beneath her feet offers from its core, channeling it from the ground and into her palms. The act of pulling the power from the soil will cause the ground to begin to lightly rumble in response in a twelve foot radius around her. Particles of what seem to be golden specs appear to be manifesting itself out of the dirt gravitate towards her, surrounding her like a beacon while she charges the spell. It’s certainly noticeable but definitely can not harm structures or disrupt movement. With the mana coalesced in her hands, they begin to glow a muted shade that appears to be a mix of gold and brown, making for a color that is easy on the eyes and oddly natural. Through physical contact only, she may let this mana flow into a severely injured target and will begin to stitch together torn flesh, muscles, broken bones, etc., over a short period of time. A healing spell powerful enough to bring back a creature from the very brink of death, but may not revive in any way a deceased target. Earth’s Beating Heart is also able to remove harmful entities from the body ( I.E. curses, poisons, bacteria. Does not affect soul-based damage.) so long as she is aware of these things and is of high enough rank to dispel them. This spell is used at a high physical cost, as well as mana. Using this will leave her feeling exhausted and sweating and takes a large chunk out of her mana pool. This spell takes one post to charge and then may be cast on the second post.<p>
